Final Project for Engineering Programming II course (EE 5453) 

In short, this project made use of publicly requested data from CRIS, a crash report database maintained by the Texas DoT, and dynamically parsed data to generate a heatmap from data supplied. 

Initial data was parsed and modified, where only relevant information was taken. 
Lines with only street information were retreived for their coordinates with Google maps API. 
"output.csv" shows what the modified data looks like, this was what was used to create visual aids like the graphs and heatmaps. 

Word document attached with requirements in this directory.
