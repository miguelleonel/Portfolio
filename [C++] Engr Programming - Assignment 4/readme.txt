Assignment 4 of my Engineering Programming course (EE 5103). 

Basic file operation C++ script to handle parsing csv data to find relevant weather metrics from the supplied weather data ("ghcnd-stations-readme.txt" + "20180101.csv"). 

Created a class to handle loading the file data into data structures (limited to vectors/strings) and dedicated functions to output desired calculations.

Requirements PDF uploaded. Both the .txt and .csv file needed, where the .txt file details information about the reporting weather station name from the .csv file.
